# unity-git
An easy-to-use bash script to setup a git repository for a Unity project. The script also takes the time to add a Unity-specific .gitignore and installs git LFS hooks.

## Usage
Place in directory that will act as your repository root. Run using `sh unity-git.sh`. Create a project in this space and get developing.
